
Certainly! Here's the pseudocode for the boundary traversal of a binary tree, explained in plain English:

1. **Function `boundaryTraversal(root)`**:
   - If the root is `None`, return an empty list because there's no tree to traverse.
   - Initialize an empty list called `boundary` to store the boundary nodes.
   - If the root is not a leaf node, add its value to the `boundary` list.
   - Call the function `addLeftBoundary` with the left child of the root and the `boundary` list.
   - Call the function `addLeaves` with the root and the `boundary` list to add all leaf nodes.
   - Call the function `addRightBoundary` with the right child of the root and the `boundary` list.
   - Return the `boundary` list, which now contains the boundary traversal of the tree.

2. **Function `isLeaf(node)`**:
   - Return `True` if the node has no left or right children, indicating it's a leaf node.
   - Otherwise, return `False`.

3. **Function `addLeftBoundary(node, boundary)`**:
   - While the node is not `None`:
     - If the node is not a leaf, add its value to the `boundary` list.
     - Move to the left child if it exists; otherwise, move to the right child.

4. **Function `addLeaves(node, boundary)`**:
   - If the node is `None`, return immediately.
   - If the node is a leaf, add its value to the `boundary` list.
   - Recursively call `addLeaves` on the left child.
   - Recursively call `addLeaves` on the right child.

5. **Function `addRightBoundary(node, boundary)`**:
   - Initialize an empty list called `temp` to temporarily store right boundary nodes.
   - While the node is not `None`:
     - If the node is not a leaf, add its value to the `temp` list.
     - Move to the right child if it exists; otherwise, move to the left child.
   - Add the nodes from `temp` to the `boundary` list in reverse order.

This pseudocode provides a step-by-step explanation of how to perform a boundary traversal on a binary tree, detailing the main functions and their roles in the process.
