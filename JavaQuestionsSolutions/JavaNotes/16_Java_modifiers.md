# Modifier
* In simple terms, Java modifiers are like tags or labels we put on different parts  
of a Java program to control who can access them and how they can be used.

* Java modifiers help us manage who can interact with different parts of our code.  

* They make sure everything stays organized and works smoothly when we're writing computer programs in Java.

e.g. 
`public class Main`

The public keyword is an access modifier, meaning that it is used to set the  
access level for classes, attributes, methods and constructors.
