# Java Packages
A package in Java is used to group related classes.  
Think of it as a folder in a file directory.    
We use packages to avoid name conflicts, and to write a better maintainable code. 

**Packages are divided into two categories**:

1. **Built-in Packages** (packages from the Java API)
2. **User-defined Packages** (create your own packages)

## Built-in Packages
1. The Java API is a library of prewritten classes, that are free to use, included in the Java Development Environment.
2. Check this complete list

3. The library is divided into packages and classes.
4. To use a class or a package from the library, you need to use the import keyword.

```
import package.name.Class;   // Import a single class
import package.name.*;   // Import the whole package
```
