# Java Iterator
1. An Iterator is an object that can be used to loop through collections, like arraylist  
and HashSet. 
2. It is called an "Iterator" because "Iterating" is the technical term for looping.
3. To use an Iterator, you must import it from the `java.util` package

So in other words  
```
An iterator is an object that enables you to traverse through a collection of elements, one element at a time. It provides a uniform way of accessing elements within different types of collections, such as lists, sets, and maps, without exposing the underlying implementation of the collection.
