# Java HashSet
A HashSet is a collection of items where every item is unique, and is found in the `java.util` package

```
Explanation:
 1. Imagine you have a magical box where you can put your toys. But in this box, you can only put one of 
 each kind of toy. If you try to put the same toy again, the box won't let you! A HashSet in Java is 
 like that magical box. It holds all your toys but makes sure you don't have duplicates.

 2. Think of a HashSet in Java as a special container where you can store a bunch of items, like toys 
 in a toy box. But unlike a regular box, a HashSet automatically makes sure you don't accidentally put 
 the same item in twice. It's like having a smart organizer for your stuff!
 
 3. In Java, a HashSet is a collection that stores unique elements. It uses a mechanism called hashing to 
 efficiently determine whether an element already exists in the set. When you add an element to a HashSet, 
 it calculates a unique code for that element and places it in the appropriate position. If you try to add 
 another element with the same code, it recognizes it as a duplicate and ignores it. This makes HashSet 
 very efficient for tasks like removing duplicates from a collection or checking for membership in a large 
 dataset.
```

e.g. Create a `HashSet` object called cars that will store strings

```
import java.util.HashSet; // Import the HashSet class
HashSet<String> cars = new HashSet<String>();
```
