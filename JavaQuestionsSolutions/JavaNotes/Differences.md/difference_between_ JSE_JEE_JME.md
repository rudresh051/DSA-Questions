## Difference between JSE, JEE and JME

**Java Standard Edition (JSE):**

- Also known as Java SE.
- Designed for general-purpose programming.
- Provides the core functionality of the Java programming language,   
including basic libraries and APIs.
- Suitable for developing desktop applications, command-line tools,   
and standalone server applications.
- Does not include specialized APIs for enterprise-level development or mobile devices.

**Java Enterprise Edition (JEE):**

- Also known as Java EE (Enterprise Edition), now rebranded as Jakarta EE.
- Built on top of Java SE.
- Designed for developing large-scale, enterprise-level applications.
- Provides additional APIs and libraries for building distributed, scalable,   
and robust applications, including web applications, enterprise integration,   
and messaging systems.
- Supports features like servlets, JavaServer Pages (JSP), Enterprise   
JavaBeans (EJB), Java Persistence API (JPA), and Java Messaging Service (JMS).
- Includes specifications for building and deploying enterprise applications on application servers.

**Java Micro Edition (JME):**

- Also known as Java ME.
- Optimized for resource-constrained devices, such as mobile phones,   
embedded systems, and consumer electronic devices.
- Provides a subset of the Java SE platform, tailored for devices with   
limited memory, processing power, and display capabilities.
- Offers APIs for developing mobile applications (MIDP - Mobile   
Information Device Profile), embedded applications, and other small-scale applications.
- Suitable for building applications for feature phones, smart cards, set-top boxes,   
and other small devices.
