## Difference between JDK, JVM, JRE

### JDK vs. JVM vs. JRE

| Aspect           | JDK (Java Development Kit) | JVM (Java Virtual Machine) | JRE (Java Runtime Environment) |
|------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Definition      | Development kit for creating Java applications, including tools, libraries, and documentation. | Runtime engine for executing Java bytecode on a computer. | Environment for running Java applications, including JVM and libraries, without development tools. |
| Components      | Includes compiler, runtime, debugger, and development tools. | Executes Java bytecode, converting it into machine-specific instructions. | Includes JVM and libraries for running Java applications. |
| Usage           | Used by developers for writing, compiling, and debugging Java code. | Used by end-users to run Java applications. | Used by end-users to execute Java programs without development capabilities. |
| Example         | Developers use JDK to create and compile Java applications. | End-users use JVM to run Java applications on their systems. | End-users install JRE to run Java programs without needing development tools. |
