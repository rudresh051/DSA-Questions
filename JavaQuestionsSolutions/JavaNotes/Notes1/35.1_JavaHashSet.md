# Java HashSet
A HashSet is a collection of items where every item is unique, and is found in the `java.util` package

```
Explanation:
 1. Imagine you have a magical box where you can put your toys. But in this box, you can only put one of 
 each kind of toy. If you try to put the same toy again, the box won't let you! A HashSet in Java is 
 like that magical box. It holds all your toys but makes sure you don't have duplicates.

 2. Think of a HashSet in Java as a special container where you can store a bunch of items, like toys 
 in a toy box. But unlike a regular box, a HashSet automatically makes sure you don't accidentally put 
 the same item in twice. It's like having a smart organizer for your stuff!

 3. In Java, a HashSet is a collection that stores unique elements. It uses a mechanism called hashing to 
 efficiently determine whether an element already exists in the set. When you add an element to a HashSet, 
 it calculates a unique code for that element and places it in the appropriate position. If you try to add 
 another element with the same code, it recognizes it as a duplicate and ignores it. This makes HashSet 
 very efficient for tasks like removing duplicates from a collection or checking for membership in a large 
 dataset.
```

e.g. Create a `HashSet` object called cars that will store strings

```
import java.util.HashSet; // Import the HashSet class
HashSet<String> cars = new HashSet<String>();
```

## Add Items
The `HashSet` class has many useful method. For example, to add items to it, use the `add()` method

```
// Import the HashSet class
import java.util.HashSet;
public class Main{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        HashSet<String> cars = new HashSet<String>();
        cars.add("Volvo");
        cars.add("BMW");
        cars.add("Ford");
        cars.add("BMW");
        cars.add("Mazda");
        System.out.println(cars);
    }
}
```
>Note: In the example above, even though BMW is added twice it only appears once in the set   
because every item in a set has to be unique.

## Check If an Item Exists
To check whether an item exists in a HashSet, use the `contains()` method  
e.g. 
`cars.contains("Mazda");` 

## Remove an Item
To remove an Item, use the `remove()` method
`cars.remove("Volvo");`  
To remove all items, use the clear() method
`cars.clear();`

## HashSet Size
To find out how many items there are, use the `size` method
import java.util.HashSet;
```
public class Main{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        HashSet<String> cars = new HashSet<String>();
        cars.add("Volvo");
        cars.add("BMW");
        cars.add("Ford");
        cars.add("Mazda");
        System.out.println(cars.size());
    }
}
// Output
4
```
## Loop through a HashSet
Loop through the items of an `HashSet` with a **for-each** loop

e.g.  
```
import java.util.HashSet;
public class Main{
    public static void main{
        HashSet<String> cars = new HashSet<String>();
        cars.add("Volvo");
        cars.add("BMW");
        cars.add("Ford");
        cars.add("Mazda");
        for(String i:cars){
            System.out.println(i);
        }
    }
}

// Output
Volvo
Mazda
Ford
BMW
```

## Other Types
Items in an HashSet are actually objects. In the examples above, we created items(objects) of   
type "String". Remember that a String in Java is an object (not a primitive type).    
to use otheer types, such as int, you must specify an equivalent wrapper class:  
for Numbers use `Integer`   
For Boolean use `Boolean`  
For char use `Character`  
For double use `Double`  

e.g. 
```
import java.util.HashSet;
public class Main{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        // Create a HashSet object called numbers
        HashSet<Integer> numbers = new HashSet<Integer>();

        // Add values to the set
        numbers.add(4);
        numbers.add(7);
        numbers.add(8);
    }
}
// Show which numbers between 1 and 10 are in the set
for(int i=1;i<=10;i++){
    if(numbers.contains(i)){
        System.out.println(i + " was found in the set.");
    }
    else{
        System.out.println(i + " was not found in the set.");
    }
}

// output
<!-- 1 was not found in the set.
2 was not found in the set.
3 was not found in the set.
4 was found in the set.
5 was not found in the set.
6 was not found in the set.
7 was found in the set.
8 was found in the set.
9 was not found in the set.
10 was not found in the set. -->
