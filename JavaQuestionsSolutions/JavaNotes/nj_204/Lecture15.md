# Abstract Class

--abstract method is also called as unimplemented method.
--normal method is also called as implemented method or concrete method.

public void funA() // method signature
{ //method body

this body can contains zero or many statements

}


--the method which is having a method body is known as implemented or concrete method.(at least zero body)

--the method without body (only singnature) is called as unimplemened  method or abstract method.
--abstract keyword must be there in that method signature.


public abstract void funA();

****Note: inside a normal class (in concreate class) we can not have any abstract methods.

### Abstract Class and Abstract Method ‚Äì Simple Explanation

---

#### üîπ **Abstract Class:**

An **abstract class** is a class that **cannot be instantiated directly** (i.e., you can‚Äôt create an object of it). It is meant to be a **blueprint** for other classes.

It **may contain:**

* **Abstract methods** (which have no body and must be implemented by child classes),
* **Non-abstract methods** (which have a body),
* Fields (variables),
* Constructors.

üëâ **Purpose:** To provide a common base for multiple related classes.

##### Example in Java:

```java
abstract class Animal {
    abstract void makeSound();  // abstract method (no body)

    void eat() {
        System.out.println("This animal eats food.");  // concrete method
    }
}
```

---

#### üîπ **Abstract Method:**

An **abstract method** is a method that:

* **Has no body** (just the method signature),
* **Must be overridden** in the subclass,
* Can only exist inside an abstract class (or interface).

##### Example:

```java
abstract void makeSound();  // No body ‚Äî must be implemented in a subclass
```

---

#### üî∏ Subclass Example:

```java
class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Bark");
    }
}
```

---

### üîç Why Use Abstract Classes and Methods?

* To enforce a **common structure** across subclasses.
* To **avoid code duplication** (reuse common methods).
* To ensure that **certain methods are implemented** in all child classes.

### üß† Quick Recap:

| Feature             | Abstract Class         | Abstract Method                        |
| ------------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Can be instantiated | ‚ùå No                   | ‚ùå No                                   |
| Has method body     | ‚úÖ Yes (some methods)   | ‚ùå No (must be overridden)              |
| Purpose             | Base for other classes | Enforce specific method implementation |

## Java Interface

In Java, an **interface** is a reference type, similar to a class, that can contain only **constants**, **method signatures**, **default methods**, **static methods**, and **nested types**. Interfaces **cannot contain instance fields or constructors**, and all methods are **implicitly public and abstract** (except static and default methods).

### Key Points:

* **Used to achieve abstraction and multiple inheritance** in Java.
* An interface defines **what a class can do**, but not **how it does it**.
* A class implements an interface using the `implements` keyword and must provide concrete implementations of the interface‚Äôs methods (unless the class is abstract).

### Syntax Example:

```java
interface Animal {
    void eat();
    void sleep();
}
```

### Implementing an Interface:

```java
class Dog implements Animal {
    public void eat() {
        System.out.println("Dog eats bones");
    }

    public void sleep() {
        System.out.println("Dog sleeps at night");
    }
}
```

---

### Interface Features (Java 8 and above):

* **Default Methods**: Provide a default implementation.

  ```java
  default void breathe() {
      System.out.println("Breathing...");
  }
  ```
* **Static Methods**: Can be called on the interface itself.

  ```java
  static void sound() {
      System.out.println("Animal sound");
  }
  ```
* **Private Methods (Java 9+)**: For internal use within the interface.

---

### When to Use an Interface:

* When you want to define a **contract** for classes.
* When multiple classes should implement **common behavior** without being in the same inheritance hierarchy.
* When you need **multiple inheritance of type**, as Java doesn‚Äôt support multiple class inheritance.
