# Abstract Class

--abstract method is also called as unimplemented method.
--normal method is also called as implemented method or concrete method.

public void funA() // method signature
{ //method body

this body can contains zero or many statements

}


--the method which is having a method body is known as implemented or concrete method.(at least zero body)

--the method without body (only singnature) is called as unimplemened  method or abstract method.
--abstract keyword must be there in that method signature.


public abstract void funA();

****Note: inside a normal class (in concreate class) we can not have any abstract methods.
