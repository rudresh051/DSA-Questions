## 🧱 Step-by-Step: Real Object-Oriented Process

---

### ✅ **1. Define the Blueprint (Class)**

A class is like a **blueprint** for objects — just like a chef's recipe book.

```java
class ChefDish {
    String ingredient;
}
```

* It defines what data (fields) and actions (methods) an object will have.

---

### ✅ **2. Use a Constructor to Initialize (Chef Gets Ingredients)**

The constructor is the **first step of the real object creation process** — where you give your object its essential starting information.

```java
public ChefDish(String ingredient) {
    this.ingredient = ingredient;
}
```

* It's **mandatory input** to make sure the object is complete and usable.
* It enforces **object readiness** from the start.

---

### ✅ **3. Create the Object (Prepare the Chef)**

Now you instantiate the class — this is the actual moment the **chef (object)** comes to life with the chosen ingredients.

```java
ChefDish dish = new ChefDish("Tomato");
```

* Memory is allocated.
* Constructor runs — now the `ingredient` is inside the object.

---

### ✅ **4. Call Methods (Chef Starts Cooking)**

Now that the chef has all he needs, you call methods to do the real work.

```java
dish.prepareDish();
```

* No need to ask again for `ingredient`.
* The object is self-sufficient — it “knows what to do.”

---

### ✅ **5. Follow OOP Principles While Doing This**

| Principle         | In Real Process                                              | In Your Code                                         |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Encapsulation** | Ingredient is inside the chef's basket, hidden               | `private` or `String ingredient;` inside the object  |
| **Abstraction**   | You don’t worry how dish is prepared, you just say "make it" | You call `prepareDish()` without caring how it works |
| **Polymorphism**  | One chef, many dishes based on ingredients                   | `prepareDish()` handles different inputs             |
| **Inheritance**   | A PastaChef could extend a ChefDish class                    | `class PastaChef extends ChefDish` (advanced usage)  |

### 🧠 Final Thought:

Just like how a **real chef follows a process**:

1. Gets ingredients ✅
2. Knows what recipe to follow ✅
3. Prepares and presents a dish ✅

An **object** in OOP:

1. Gets initialized via constructor ✅
2. Uses internal state to decide what to do ✅
3. Executes methods to perform actions ✅
