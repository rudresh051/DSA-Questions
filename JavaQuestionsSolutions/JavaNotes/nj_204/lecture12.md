# Inheritance
In Java, inheritance is one of the core concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It allows a new class (called a subclass or child class) to acquire (or inherit) the fields (variables) and methods of an existing class (called a superclass or parent class).

In simple words:
Inheritance lets you create a new class based on an existing class, reusing code, and adding new features or modifying existing ones without rewriting the original code.

**Types of Inheritance in Java:**
Single Inheritance: One class inherits from another.

Multilevel Inheritance: A class inherits from a class which is itself a subclass.

Hierarchical Inheritance: Multiple classes inherit from a single parent class.

(Java does not support multiple inheritance with classes to avoid ambiguity; instead, it supports multiple inheritance through interfaces.)
