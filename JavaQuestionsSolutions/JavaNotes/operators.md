Java divides the operators into the following groups:

* Arithmetic operators => `+, -, *, /, %, ++, --`
* Assignment operators
    * It is used to assign values to variable
    * e.g. `=, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, &=, |=, ^=, >>=, <<=`
* Comparison operators
    * Comparison operators are used to compare two values (or variables)  
    * The return value of a comparison is either **true** or **false**
    * e.g. `==, !=, >, <, >=, <=`
* Logical operators
    * You can also test for true or false values with logical operators.
    * e.g. `&&, ||, !`
* Bitwise operators
    * Bitwise operators are used to performing the manipulation of individual bits of a number. 
    * They can be used with any integral type (char, short, int, etc.). 
    * They are used when performing update and query operations of the Binary indexed trees.
    * e.g. Bitwise OR(|), Bitwise AND(&), Bitwise XOR(^), Bitwise complement(~) 
    
```
a = 5 = 0101 (In Binary)
b = 7 = 0111 (In Binary)

Bitwise OR Operation of 5 and 7
  0101
| 0111
 ________
  0111  = 7 (In decimal) 
```
